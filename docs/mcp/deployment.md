# MCP Deployment

Use the deployment mode that matches the trust boundary of the KiCad project.

| Mode                    | Use when                                                           | Reference                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Local stdio             | The MCP client launches the server directly.                       | [Transport](transport.md)                    |
| Local Streamable HTTP   | The extension or another local client connects over loopback.      | [Transport](transport.md)                    |
| Docker                  | You want a repeatable containerized runtime.                       | [Docker deployment](../deployment/docker.md) |
| Tunnel or reverse proxy | A remote connector needs HTTPS access to a local or hosted server. | [Docker deployment](../deployment/docker.md) |

## Security Defaults

- Bind HTTP servers to `127.0.0.1` unless a trusted reverse proxy controls access.
- Set a strong bearer token before exposing HTTP outside loopback.
- Mount project directories read-only for inspection workflows.
- Keep generated manufacturing/output paths separated from source projects.

Supply-chain and release-integrity controls are documented in [security](../security.md).

# Professional Circuit Design Workflow

Use the `professional_circuit_design` prompt when an agent is creating a board
from scratch or taking a schematic through manufacturing export.

The v3 workflow adds three guardrails:

- `project_set_design_intent()` should be called before schematic capture so
  placement and quality gates do not fall back to generic defaults.
- `sch_add_missing_junctions()` should be called after generated wiring so
  KiCad net connectivity matches what is visible on the page.
- `pcb_sync_from_schematic()` runs a pre-sync gate and blocks dirty schematic
  transfer unless `force=True` is deliberately used for debugging.

After placement, run the `post_placement_routing` prompt. It standardizes the
DSN export, FreeRouting, SES import, zone refill, and DRC loop so agents do not
skip routing cleanup.
